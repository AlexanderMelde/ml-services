|     6.9 | I can't find the `outputs` folder | The files are generated in the folder that contains the opened `.ipynb` jupyter file. Most likely, they will be at `udacity-intro-to-ml-labs/aml-visual-interface/lab-19/notebook/outputs` [[view post](https://microsoftmlchallenge.slack.com/archives/C016D8H6BJR/p1595699977334800?thread_ts=1595699834.334500&cid=C016D8H6BJR)] |
|    6.18 | error `Invalid graph: You have invalid dataset(s)` when trying to create a real-time inference pipeline | click the button to the right of the deploy button (three dots) and choose cloning. Once you clone, try again and the issue should be resolved.

|     6.9 | inside the code of the notebook there is the following code: ```run = experiment.start_logging(); run.log(“alpha_value”, alpha)```. From what i understand that opens a log files and logs in there the information we ask it to log. is that right ? If that is right did anyone figure out where we can check this log file after we execute the notebook ? | The name logs is a bit misleading, but it's a special type of log on the experiment object. Those values are available as "Metrics" under the given experiment.

|     6.9 | When opening the output file, i see "Error! [filename] is not UTF-8 encoded. Saving disabled. See Console for more details." | Pickle files are binary, and therefore not UTF8 encoded. They don't contain printable characters that jupyter could show, but instead a lot of binary zeroes and ones - which we humans don't understand if we would take a look at them. It is okay for the file to be binary, as your code frameworks can read them, e.g. using the pickle.load function. Once converted, humans might be able to read them as well. But while they are on disk, you don't need to read it. Just make sure it's > 0 bytes and no errors are thrown during generation  [[view post](https://microsoftmlchallenge.slack.com/archives/C0174DS4R08/p1595873241063300?thread_ts=1595770954.402500&cid=C0174DS4R08)] |
|     6.9 | how to commit to a github repository from a jupyter instance? | Assuming you have write access to the repository, from a terminal, push to the repository over https. Use the following commands: `git clone https://github.com/mygithubusername/udacity-intro-to-ml-labs`, `cd udacity-intro-to-ml-labs`, `git config --global user.name "My Name"` , `git config --global user.email myemail@example.com`, `git add .`, `git commit -m"Added changes ..."`, `git push`.

|     6.5 | What's the diference between Real-time Inferencing, Batch Inferencing and Lambda architecture? | lamba is the architecture where it helps you to process 2 types of requests. Real time data is usually a single input request where the priority is to get results  asap within millsecs. Time is the constraint. Like avoid fraud attacks right there itself. Batch inferencing allows delays to process request and drive results. It's more to be used if you want to analyze batch of new input data and make some changes to your existing model architecture.

|     6.4 | What's the difference between compute resources, compute instances and compute clusters? | a compute resource refers to a compute object that can be used in the Azure machine learning environment. That resource can either be a compute instance or a compute cluster.   A compute cluster is a cluster of computers created using single/multiple compute nodes [[view post 1 (overview)](https://microsoftmlchallenge.slack.com/archives/C016D8H6BJR/p1595832933429000?thread_ts=1595830898.428800&cid=C016D8H6BJR), [view post 2 (detailed)](https://microsoftmlchallenge.slack.com/archives/C0171MB80FP/p1595918534474500)] |
